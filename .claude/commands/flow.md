Look at the $ARGUMENTS flow and give me a to the point itemized run down of what's already implemented, what is missing, any api endpoints or data that will be required and any questions, open items or decisions I may need to make. All should pertain directly to what is already implemented from the flow or not. This is not a run down of missing or existing code, or implenetation details, it's strictly about features and do they exist or not. It's a direct comparison to the flow. If nothing is implemented or nothing is missing just say "nothing". The API requirements are only what is needed for the flow, a delete endpoint, an update, etc, it's not a run down of API functionality, it's only what is expected to exist from the App's point of view. The last section about questions/concerns/etc, need to be on point, don't make up questions or concerns out of sycophancy just becasue it was asked, they need to be relevant. 4 simple sections, to the point, without any bloat. And I stress NO BLOAT.
